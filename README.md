# Assignment #2
1. Write code to measure the execution time of F(1), F(2), ..., F(100) using both methods. Plot the results as a line chart. (if your program crashes during computation F(n+1) or takes too much time (>12hours) to compute one value, you can just stop and report the maximum value of n.)/n

3. Let's measure the degree of overlapping subproblem. Calculate the times are F(4) computed when we compute F(5),F(6),.....,F(50). Plot the results into line chart./n
